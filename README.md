# Notezy

Notezy is an innovative project which aims at helping student make organized notes. It makes use of lightweight OCR models to extract text from pdf or classroom PPTs and then send it to a Large Language Model
for further processing. The LLM corrects the spelling errors on its own and provides notes in a required format. This is an OpenSource project and is free to use. To make it free and helpful to all EasyOCR is 
used for text recognition and open-source LLM like Llama-2-chat-7b is used as the primary LLM. The project is still in development phase, so buckle up and wait for new releases!
